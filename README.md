Project Objective
=================

This project is to measure the the Normalized edit distance and Longest common subsequence between two sequences.

(1) Implementation of algorithm for normalized edit distance.

(2) Implementation of LCS algorithm that stores entire table.

(3) Implementation of LCS algorithm that uses linear memory.



Program Design
===============

The java project attached contains the following files.

	1. MainClass.java
	2. EditDistance.java
	3. LCS.java
	4. NaiveImplementaion.java


###MainClass.java

It contains the main method, where we can give inputs and get the output.

###EditDistance.java

It contains the implementation of the algorithm to find the normalized edit distance.

###LCS.java

It contain the implementation of both linear and non-linear algorithm to find the longest common subsequence.

###NaiveImplementation.java

It contains the naive implementation to find the normalized edit distance.



To run the program:
===================

1. Navigate to the source path that contains all the 4 above mentioned files.

2. Execute the following command without quotes in cmd or terminal

	
   "javac MainClass.java && java MainClass filename1.txt filename2.txt"


3. Replace the filename1.txt and filename2.txt with the appropriate filenames.

4. The text files should be in the same path as the other 4 .java files

5. Dont forget the .txt extension!
